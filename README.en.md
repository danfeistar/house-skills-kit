**Agent Skills for the Chinese real-estate industry — organized by role, usable one skill at a time.**

English | [中文](README.md)

This repository packages the day-to-day knowledge of Chinese real-estate practitioners into installable AI Skills: standardized `SKILL.md` instruction sets plus dependency-free Python tooling for the calculations that practitioners actually run (mortgage, property tax, provident-fund limits, floor-area efficiency, commission, rental yield, and more).

> 🇨🇳 The content is Chinese-first by design — it encodes how business is actually done in the Chinese market (35-city policy rule library, `认房不认贷` first-home determination, `公积金` loans, `维修基金`, etc.). The skill format is plain `SKILL.md`, so it drops into Claude Code, Hermes, Codex, OpenClaw, or any agent that reads Markdown-based skills.

> **First time here? Read [docs/QUICKSTART.md](docs/QUICKSTART.md)** (Chinese) — 5-minute setup for three runtimes (Claude Code project/user level, Codex via `AGENTS.md` routing, or paste-in-a-chat), three real walk-throughs (a resale agent matching a buyer, a planner building a competitor report, a first-home buyer deciding), plus the usage discipline and the five most common mistakes.

## Why this exists

Searching GitHub, ClawHub, and the major AI app marketplaces for AI skills built for Chinese real estate turns up essentially nothing — despite the industry transacting on the order of ten trillion RMB a year. So this is an attempt at the first, and hopefully most practical, Chinese real-estate AI skill library: business knowledge from the field, turned into skills an agent can actually execute.

**The difference between this and a prompt dump:** every module here (lead grading rules, commission policy, sales scripts, handover inspection checklists, city tax brackets) comes from first-line practice and corporate-standardized workflows, not from an engineer imagining what the domain looks like. Engineers know AI; practitioners know real estate.

## What's inside

### 🧮 calc-toolkit — shared calculation toolset (all roles)

Command-line tools covering the core calculation scenarios of a property transaction. **Pure Python standard library — no installation, no dependencies, Python 3.8+.**

| # | Tool | Command | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| 7-1 | Mortgage payment | `mortgage.py` | Commercial / provident-fund / combined loans × equal-installment or equal-principal; rates resolved per city |
| 7-2 | Resale total cost | `tax.py` | Deed tax, VAT, income tax + agent/appraisal/guarantee fees; buyer and seller split |
| 7-3 | Early repayment | `prepay.py` | Shorten-term vs reduce-payment comparison, penalty and minimum-amount warnings |
| 7-5 | Affordability | `capacity.py` | Income and debt → max loan → max price, dual bank-style ratios, bottleneck diagnosis |
| 7-6 | New-home cost | `newhome.py` | Deed tax, maintenance fund (by city × property type), first-year property fee, registration |
| 6 | First/second-home status | `status.py` | Three independent tests (commercial loan / provident fund / deed tax), sell-one-buy-one chaining |
| 7-15 | Floor premium check | `floor.py` | Floor correction × stacked discounts — detects "raise-then-discount" |
| 7-16 | Provident-fund limit | `fund.py` | Minimum of four caps: ceiling / price ratio / repayment ability / balance × deposit-months; multi-child and green-building uplifts |
| 7-17 | Commission calculator | `commission.py` | Resale commission split, channel tiered dual-algorithm reconciliation, rebates, team splits |
| 7-18 | Efficiency ratio | `efficiency.py` | Gross ↔ net ↔ shared ↔ usable area chain; unit-price conversion both ways |
| 7-19 | Rental yield | `rent.py` | Price-to-rent, gross/net yield, payback years, five reference bands, target back-solving |

**35-city rule library** (tier-1 + strong tier-2 + provincial capitals incl. Kunming) with a **four-layer rule engine**:

```
national default → city (e.g. Kunming high-rise maintenance fund 90 CNY/㎡) → district → my-own template
```

- Every number is traceable: output carries its parameter source; rule layers cite the document/number (e.g. "2024 deed-tax announcement No.16: 140㎡ threshold")
- Policy data is separated from code: policy changes mean editing `rules/cities.yaml`, not the tools
- Any parameter can be overridden inline: `--set dti=0.55`

### 🏠 Buyer-side skill (individual home buyers)

| Skill | Content | For |
|---|---|---|

> The advisory line handles judgment and trade-offs only; floor execution lives in the sales-floor line below, and every calculation runs through [calc-toolkit](skills/calc-toolkit/).

### 🔑 Resale brokerage line (brokerages and second-hand stores)

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/danfeistar/house-skills-kit.git
cd house-skills-kit

# 1) Run a calculation — no install, stdlib only
python3 skills/calc-toolkit/mortgage.py --price 1500000 --downpay 30 --years 30 --city 昆明
python3 skills/calc-toolkit/capacity.py --income 12000,8000 --cash 400000 --debts 1500 --city 昆明
python3 skills/calc-toolkit/tax.py --price 1500000 --area 89 --city 昆明 --first 1 --held 6 --unique 1

# 2) Use a skill — each directory is a self-contained SKILL.md
cat skills/buyer-first-home-advisor/SKILL.md

# 3) Generate a white-labeled advisory skill from a brand config
python3 render.py --config examples/kunming/kunming.buy.yaml --out output/my-brand/
```

## Repository structure

```
skills/            # 18 self-contained skills, each with SKILL.md (+ README.md, playbook, optional tools)
  calc-toolkit/    #   shared calculators + 35-city rule library (rules/cities.yaml)
  buyer-*/         #   buyer-side (C-end) skills
  sales-*/         #   sales-floor skills
template/
  archetypes/      # 4 role archetypes (buyer / developer sales / brokerage agent / channel distributor)
  modules/         # 31 business modules to compose an archetype
examples/          # runnable brand configs (Kunming end-to-end example, developer example)
adapters/mock/     # mock data adapter — swap in your own listing source
render.py          # renders a branded skill from a config + template
tools/             # repo maintenance scripts (skill validator, see CONTRIBUTING)
```

## Two production lines

1. **`skills/` — directly publishable skills**: each subdirectory is an independent `SKILL.md`, publishable to ClawHub as its own skill and installable on its own.
2. **`template/` — branded generation skeleton**: 4 role archetypes × 31 business modules; one brand config yields a bespoke advisor skill (`render.py`).
